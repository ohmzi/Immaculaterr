# Design System

## Design Goals
- Clean, modern, premium aesthetic
- Consistent across desktop and mobile
- Subtle depth and motion
- Accessible and readable

---

## Color & Theme
- Support light and dark themes
- Use semantic colors (background, surface, accent, destructive)
- Avoid hardcoded colors outside tokens

---

## Typography
- Clear hierarchy:
  - Page title
  - Section title
  - Body
  - Meta / helper text
- Prefer fewer font sizes with strong spacing

---

## Spacing & Layout
- Consistent spacing scale
- Use whitespace intentionally
- Avoid cramped layouts

---

## Motion
- Transitions should feel natural and fast
- Motion supports clarity, not decoration
- Avoid distracting animations

---

## Responsive Philosophy
- Desktop ≠ Mobile
- Layouts must adapt structurally
- Navigation patterns must change per device

---

## Accessibility
- Sufficient contrast
- Focus states
- Keyboard navigation where applicable
