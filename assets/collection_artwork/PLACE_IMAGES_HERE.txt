## Automatic Application

Once you place the images in the correct directories, they will be automatically uploaded to Plex when:
- Collections are created for the first time
- Collections are updated by the refresher scripts

The system will automatically detect and apply the artwork. If images are not found, collections will use Plex's default artwork (no error will occur).
